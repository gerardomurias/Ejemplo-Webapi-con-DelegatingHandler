# Ejemplo-Webapi-con-DelegatingHandler
A pipeline of message processing components is a common pattern in many frameworks that deal with messages. WCF channels, ASP.NET modules, Connect middleware (in Node.js) and many other frameworks all provide components that receive a request, return a response, and provide extensibility to a message processing pipeline.  ASP.NET Web API message handlers are classes derived from the System.Net.Http.HttpMessageHandler class.  The main method for message handlers is the SendAsync method, which receives a parameter of type HttpRequestMessage and returns a Task&lt;HttpResponseMessage>. The common behavior for most message handlers is to call another message handler creating a pipeline, and perform some processing either on the HttpRequestMessage before passing it to the inner message handler or on the HttpResponseMessage returned from the SendAsync method of the inner message handler.  ASP.NET Web API also provides the System.Net.Http.DelegatingHandler class as a base class for message handlers that include a property called InnerHandler and an implementation of the SendAsync that invokes the inner handler to simplify creating message handlers for a pipeline.  The following code shows a simple handler created by deriving from the DelegatingHandler class.
